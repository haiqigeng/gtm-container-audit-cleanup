# GTM Container Audit Cleanup

Agent-neutral skill for deep Google Tag Manager container audits, cleanup
planning, safe cleanup execution, and QA support. It is designed for Codex,
Claude Code, Gemini, or any agent that can read Markdown instructions and work
with exported GTM container JSON, GTM API/UI evidence, screenshots, or runtime
observations.

## What This Repository Contains

- `SKILL.md`: the main agent workflow and operating rules.
- `agents/openai.yaml`: Codex skill metadata and default prompt.
- `references/`: focused audit, cleanup, reporting, QA, and safety playbooks.
- `scripts/`: optional deterministic helpers for GTM JSON inspection, diffs,
  artifact validation, workbook gates, and release checks.

The skill is instruction-first. Python is recommended for repeatable
large-container analysis, but it is not required to read or apply the workflow.

## Core Behavior

- Audit deeply by default; do not downgrade scope unless the user asks for a
  limited review.
- Complete required D1-D3 review from export, API, UI, source, or code evidence.
  Only D4 runtime proof may be deferred without making the audit incomplete.
- Treat cleanup as one workflow covering naming, unused objects, duplicates,
  consolidation, consent, GA4/current Google tags, media/vendor payloads,
  ecommerce, custom code, server-side caution, folders, templates, and QA.
- Use official Google, CMP, and vendor documentation as the source of truth for
  standard events, payload shape, consent expectations, and validation methods.
- Mutate GTM only after explicit approval, in a dedicated workspace, with a
  rollback export. Never publish or create GTM versions unless explicitly asked.
- Keep user-facing cleanup plans and change logs concise and actionable. Keep
  raw proof matrices, validator traces, and scratch reasoning in backing files
  or hidden workbook tabs.

## Quick Start

Ask the agent to use this skill with the available GTM evidence and context:

```text
Use this skill to audit GTM-XXXXXXX_workspace123.json for https://example.com.
It is a web GTM container for a lead-generation site with OneTrust CMP.
Prepare the audit and cleanup plan only. Do not modify GTM yet.
```

For approved cleanup, choose the route before any operation is generated:

- Direct GTM API/MCP cleanup in a new workspace for readable in-place changes.
- Importable JSON only when that route is explicitly chosen and validated.
- Runtime QA when browser, Tag Assistant, network, consent, or vendor-platform
  proof is required.

```powershell
python scripts/gtm_export_inspect.py path\to\container.json
python scripts/gtm_validate_artifact.py path\to\artifact.json --mode overwrite
python scripts/gtm_diff_operations.py original.json cleaned.json

## Release And Versioning

Use Calendar Versioning for public releases:

- Tag format: `vYYYY.MM.DD` for the first release of a day.
- Same-day follow-up format: `vYYYY.MM.DD.N`, where `N` starts at `1`.
- Release title format: `GTM Container Audit Cleanup vYYYY.MM.DD[.N]`.
- Release notes should summarize user-visible changes, safety/validation changes,
  and the validation commands that passed.

Historical timestamped tags are kept for traceability. New releases should use
the CalVer pattern above.

Optional release check:

```powershell
python scripts/check_release.py --tag v2026.06.28
```

## Privacy And Repository Hygiene

This repository should contain only reusable skill instructions and generic
helper scripts. Do not commit client-specific GTM exports, audit workbooks,
container IDs, domains, emails, screenshots, or generated reports.

Before release:

```powershell
python scripts/check_release.py --tag vYYYY.MM.DD
git status --short
```

## Safety Notes

- Do not delete objects based on age alone.
- Do not rewrite custom HTML by replacing GTM variable references with hardcoded
  values.
- Do not treat Universal Analytics as the default for ambiguous Google events.
- Do not mark required D3 work as blocked when export/source/code evidence is
  available.
- Do not use same-container JSON imports for broad readable rename reviews; use
  direct GTM API/MCP or a name-preserving review artifact instead.
