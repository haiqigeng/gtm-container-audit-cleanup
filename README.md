# GTM Container Audit Cleanup Skill

Agent-neutral workflow for deep Google Tag Manager container audits and cleanup
planning. It is designed for Codex, Claude Code, Gemini, or any agent that can
read Markdown instructions and work with exported GTM container JSON.

## What It Does

- Audits web and server-side GTM containers from exported JSON, API/UI evidence,
  Tag Assistant observations, screenshots, or implementation notes.
- Builds full inventories for tags, triggers, variables, folders, templates,
  consent settings, custom HTML/JavaScript, and dependencies.
- Checks GA4/current Google tag implementations, consent mode, CMP routing,
  server-side tagging, media pixels, custom code, naming, duplicates, and
  consolidation opportunities.
- Uses official Google and vendor documentation as the source of truth for
  standard events, payload shape, consent expectations, and validation methods.
- Adds completion gates, limited-audit boundaries, severity calibration, vendor
  playbooks, runtime QA templates, route-aware operation tables, importable JSON
  checks, and change logs without publishing or creating GTM versions.

## Core Principles

- Audit deeply by default.
- Mutate only after explicit approval.
- Prefer direct GTM API/MCP cleanup in a new workspace for in-place changes.
- Use importable JSON only when that route is intentionally chosen.
- Treat cleanup and optimization as one workflow.
- Apply naming standardization as a mandatory cleanup step unless explicitly
  excluded or blocked by unclear business meaning.
- Keep proposed final names unique within each GTM layer.

## Using The Skill

Give the agent:

- GTM export JSON, or GTM API/UI evidence.
- Website domain and business model.
- Web/server-side scope.
- CMP and consent assumptions.
- Whether the task is audit-only, cleanup planning, direct cleanup, or JSON.

Example:

```text
Use this skill to audit GTM-XXXXXXX_workspace123.json for https://example.com.
It is a web GTM container, lead-generation site, OneTrust CMP. Do audit first,
then prepare a cleanup plan. Do not modify GTM yet.
```

For direct cleanup, create a new GTM workspace first and keep a rollback export.
Do not publish unless explicitly requested.

## Helper Scripts

The bundled Python scripts are optional accelerators. They use exported GTM JSON
to inspect inventories, produce diffs, generate same-container patches, and
validate artifacts.

Useful commands:

```powershell
python scripts/gtm_export_inspect.py path\to\container.json
python scripts/gtm_validate_artifact.py path\to\artifact.json --mode overwrite
python scripts/gtm_diff_operations.py original.json cleaned.json
python scripts/gtm_audit_gate_check.py reconciliation.xlsx
python scripts/gtm_self_test.py
```

Python is not required to understand or apply the skill instructions, but it is
recommended for repeatable large-container analysis.

## Safety Notes

- Do not publish GTM versions from this skill unless explicitly requested.
- Do not delete objects based on age alone.
- Do not rewrite custom HTML by replacing GTM variable references with hardcoded
  values.
- Do not treat Universal Analytics as the default for ambiguous Google events.
- Do not use same-container JSON imports for readable broad rename reviews; use
  direct GTM API/MCP or a name-preserving review artifact instead.

## Status

This repository contains the reusable skill and generic helper scripts only. It
should not contain client-specific exports, audit workbooks, IDs, domains,
emails, or test artifacts.
