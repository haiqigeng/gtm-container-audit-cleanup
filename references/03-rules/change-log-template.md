# Change Log Template

Use this reference when producing a post-cleanup change log or a generated-JSON
review log.

- Required Columns
- Coherence Rules
- Output Boundary

## Purpose

The cleanup plan is the decision source. The change log is the execution record.
Do not make the change log a second audit or a place for new analysis.

The change log should contain only what changed, why it changed, impact, QA,
owner/status, and rollback/evidence notes needed for review. It must be
granular enough for the user to understand the applied change without opening
GTM View Changes, while still avoiding raw JSON, code dumps, and proof matrices.

## Required Columns

Use exactly these columns unless the user explicitly requests another schema:

```text
Change ID
Operation ID
Layer
Object ID
Object type
Before name
After name
Action
Before state / value
After state / value
Reason / decision
Functional impact
Consent / privacy impact
Dependencies updated
QA priority
QA method
QA status
Rollback note
Evidence / source
Owner / blocker
Status
```

`Before state / value` and `After state / value` must describe the behavior,
name, dependency, trigger routing, payload field, variable source, consent
setting, or folder/template relationship that actually changed. Do not fill
them with generic text such as `updated`, `reviewed`, or `see GTM`.

Recommended action values:

- `Created`
- `Updated`
- `Renamed`
- `Paused`
- `Deleted`
- `Moved folder`
- `Dependency remapped`
- `Documented exception`
- `No-op / Route-limited`

## Coherence Rules

Before delivering both cleanup plan and change log:

- every change-log row maps to a cleanup operation `Change ID`, except explicit
  `No-op / Documented exception` rows;
- object IDs, before names, after names, action, reason/decision, impact, QA,
  owner, and status do not contradict the cleanup plan;
- if semantic checks discover a bad setup after the plan was drafted, update the
  cleanup operation first, then mirror the executed/generated change in the
  change log;
- deferred semantic issues appear as deferred/blocker operations, not as changed
  rows;
- naming, JSON route, and rollback notes match the selected execution route.
- the row can be understood on its own by an analytics or business owner who
  has not opened GTM View Changes.

## Output Boundary

Do not expose raw JSON, full semantic matrices, raw code/config, validator
traces, scratch reasoning, or full dependency graphs in the change log. Put that
evidence in hidden proof tabs or technical appendices when needed.

The row should be understandable to a business or analytics owner without
reading proof tabs, while still linking to operation/finding IDs for expert
review.
