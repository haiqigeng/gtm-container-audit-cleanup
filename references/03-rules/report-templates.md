Use `summary-quality.md` for Custom Code Semantic Review wording. The
`Expected output / side effect` and runtime-risk fields must explain what the
object reads, returns, loads, pushes, mutates, or calls, plus the judgment. Do
not use generic phrases such as `custom code inspected`, `external URL found`,
`dataLayer push detected`, or `no obvious browser side effect` as the main
summary.

## Workstream Reconciliation Table

Use this table to prove that audit scope, measurement diagnosis, semantic
validation, and cleanup decisions reconcile. A completed audit or cleanup plan
must not have unresolved rows.

## Cleanup Roadmap

```text
Phase:
Goal:
Included findings:
Operations:
Dependencies:
Risk:
Verification:
Owner decision needed:
Changed layers:
Deferred layers and blockers:
```

Recommended phases:

1. Consent/privacy and broken measurement fixes.
2. Revenue/GA4 ecommerce and conversion accuracy.
3. Gateway/consolidation design for similar tags, triggers, and variables.
4. Duplicate/redundant object cleanup after consolidation impact is known.
5. Custom code and payload simplification.
6. Naming, folders, and documentation.

Apply naming standardization in phase 6 only after semantic fixes,
consolidation, and deletion decisions are stable. If the user asks only for
audit or planning, include the proposed naming convention and rename blockers.

## Next-Step Requirement

Every completed audit, cleanup phase, importable JSON
delivery, QA pass, and final handoff must include `Recommended next step`.
Use a concrete action, not a generic closing sentence:

- If audit-only is complete, recommend validation decisions, cleanup route
  selection, runtime QA, or missing evidence collection.
- If a cleanup phase is complete, recommend the next phase and whether it
  needs user approval.
- If cleanup is complete, recommend QA, change-log generation, stakeholder
  review, import, or publish-readiness review.
- If blocked, name the missing evidence, owner decision, access, or legal/CMP
  validation needed.

## Spreadsheet-Friendly Tabs

Default stakeholder workbooks should use compact tabs, usually no more than
7-8 total tabs and 5-6 decision columns per tab. Use expanded technical tabs
only when the user asks for them or a validation workflow requires them.

Recommended compact audit/cleanup plan tabs:

- `01 Summary`
- `02 Cleanup Plan`
- `03 D3 Evidence`
- `04 Inventory & Dependencies`
- `05 Synergy & Consolidation`
- `06 QA & Blockers`
- `07 References & Validation`

Recommended `02 Cleanup Plan` columns:

```text
ID:
Level: Summary | Detail | Single
Affected object(s):
Issue / evidence:
Recommended action:
QA / status:
```

Use `Summary` rows only as visual parents. Put concrete object findings
directly beneath them as `Detail` rows with IDs such as `F001.1`, `F001.2`, and
so on. Use `Single` when the row is already object-specific. Do not collapse
distinct object-level findings into a family row without detail rows.

Use one `Single` row for generic hygiene batches when the whole batch has the
same evidence, action, QA, and rollback: unused variables/triggers/tags, exact
duplicates, naming convention, folder organization, and other mechanical
cleanup. Split into detail rows as soon as the business logic, dependency risk,
or recommended action differs by object.

Recommended `03 D3 Evidence` columns:

```text
Object:
Literal behavior:
Consumer / context:
Analyst judgment:
Cleanup implication:
Evidence / QA blocker:
```

Use the larger legacy tab list below only for technical appendices, validator
fixtures, or explicit user requests.

When creating a workbook or CSV set, use these stable tabs:

- `00 Method`: scope, source exports/workspaces, evidence freshness, analysis
  method, ignored metadata fields, confidence rules, limitations.
- `01 Executive Summary`: counts by layer/category/severity/status/priority and
  top recommended actions.
- `02 Findings`: one row per audit finding using the Finding Table columns.
- `03 Inventory - Tags`: name, ID, type, folder, firing triggers, blocking
  triggers, consent, last edited when known, usage status, notes.
- `04 Inventory - Triggers`: name, ID, type, event/filter summary, connected
  tags, folder, usage status, notes.
- `05 Inventory - Variables`: name, ID, type, key/config summary, consumers,
  folder, usage status, notes.
- `06 Consent & Routing`: CMP events, consent mode defaults/updates, blocking
  triggers, trigger groups, vendor pageview patterns, client-to-server consent
  forwarding, server-side validation blockers, exceptions.
- `06b Measurement Diagnosis`: business model, decision outcome, conversion
  hierarchy, vendor/platform role, expected event/payload contract,
  intent blockers, linked semantic rows, and linked operations.
- `07 Semantic Object Matrix`: in a full audit, one row per tag, trigger,
  variable, custom template, and referenced configuration branch; in a limited
  audit, one row per scoped object or reviewed family:
  object ID/name/layer, vendor/family, inferred business role, decision outcome,
  conversion hierarchy, platform role, expected data contract, depth required and
  completed, trigger-context status, configuration/code logic status,
  source/output status, consent/server status, evidence level, semantic status,
  confidence, linked finding/operation, runtime QA, and blocker/next evidence.
  If depth required includes `D3`, include D3 inputs/sources, D3 logic summary,
  D3 output or side effect, D3 consumer expectation, and D3 correctness
  decision. Missing D3 proof means incomplete audit, not deferred cleanup.
  Keep raw parameter dumps out of this tab unless they are needed as proof.
- `07b Custom Code Semantic Review`: object-level Custom HTML, Custom
  JavaScript, and custom-template purpose, role category, export review status,
  side effects, consent assumption, consumers, risk, semantic status, cleanup
  recommendation, aggressiveness options, QA method, and blocker.
- `08 Official Docs Map`: vendor/platform, implemented event, official source,
  required/recommended parameters, expected data types, observed gap, and whether
  resolution is GTM-only or requires website/dataLayer work.
- `08b Vendor Playbook Coverage`: vendor/family, object IDs, official sources,
  playbook checks applied, base/event/payload/consent/ecommerce status, runtime
  QA status, linked findings, deferred evidence, and confidence.
- `09 GA4 DataLayer Contracts`: GA4 event, official event, trigger event,
  expected event-level parameters, expected item fields, actual dataLayer paths,
  legacy UA path risks, outgoing payload evidence, and resolution type.
- `10 Consolidation Map`: exact duplicates, similar patterns, gateway
  candidates, proposed replacements, and objects that become obsolete.
- `11 Naming Standardization`: proposed convention, object ID, before name,
  after name, layer, reason, dependency risk, uniqueness status, collision
  resolution suffix when needed, and blocker when not renamed.
- `12 Cleanup Roadmap`: phased cleanup plan with dependencies, QA,
  recommended aggressiveness, and selectable aggressiveness alternatives.
- `13 Runtime QA Plan`: Tag Assistant/browser/network/vendor-platform checks,
  consent state, URL/page type, expected GTM event, expected tags, expected
  network requests, expected payload fields, owner, status, evidence, and
  blocker.
- `14 Route Strategy`: execution route, import mode, conflict strategy,
  in-place/replacement rationale, old-to-new map, and decommission plan.
- `15 Operations`: structured operation table using the Operation Table fields,
  including recommended aggressiveness and user-selectable alternatives.
- `16 Change Log`: only when changes were made or approved.
- `17 Deferred Blockers`: objects or patterns not changed, blocker type,
  missing evidence, owner, and recommended next action.
- `18 Completion Ledger`: mandatory workstream, overall status, inventory phase
  status, dependency phase status, measurement diagnosis phase status, semantic
  validation phase status, cleanup decision phase status, report reconciliation
  phase status, affected
  layer/object scope, evidence, blocker, required next evidence, owner, and
  next action.
- `18b Workstream Reconciliation`: workstream/object family, total source count,
  inventoried count, dependency-mapped count, measurement-diagnosed count,
  semantically validated count, cleanup-decision count, deferred count, not
  applicable count, user-excluded
  count, unresolved count, reconciliation formula status, failed gate, affected
  objects, blocker, risk, required next evidence, owner, and next action.
- `19 Generated JSON QA`: for importable JSON only; parse status, unique ID
  check, missing references, duplicate configurations, unresolved unused
  objects, GA4/current Google vs UA exception status, naming/logic mismatches,
  residual blockers, import mode, conflict strategy, and import readiness.

Use `Keep`, `Currently unused`, `Consolidation obsolete`,
`Delete candidate`, `Not sure`, `Needs owner validation`, and `Do not delete` as
usage-status values. Avoid plain `Delete` unless deletion was explicitly
approved and verified.

## Workbook And Summary Routing

For XLSX cleanup plans, use `workbook-architecture.md`. It defines the default
two-tab visible decision layer, hidden proof tabs, duplicate-column discipline,
and workbook validation commands.

For semantic summary wording and the user-facing boundary, use
`summary-quality.md`. Cleanup plans should judge configuration and expose
findings, blockers, operations, QA, owner decisions, and next steps; proof tabs
hold raw D1/D2/D3 evidence.

## Change Log Columns

Use `change-log-template.md` for the required change-log columns, action
values, coherence rules, and output boundary. The change log must explain the
human-visible before/after behavior of each applied or generated change well
enough that an analytics owner can review what happened without opening GTM
View Changes.

## Cleanup Plan And Change Log Coherence

The cleanup plan is the decision source and the change log is the execution
record. Before delivering both files, apply the coherence checks in
`change-log-template.md`.

Do not let the two files drift: operation IDs, object IDs, before/after names,
reason, functional impact, QA method, blocker, and status must tell the same
story. If execution discovers new facts, update the cleanup plan first and then
mirror the final change-log row.

## Output Format Selection

Follow the user's requested format. If unspecified:

1. Prefer `.xlsx` when the environment can create it reliably.
2. Prefer native Google Sheets only when a Drive/Sheets connector is available
   and the user wants collaborative cloud output.
3. Otherwise create Markdown plus CSV files, one CSV per tab.

Do not assume a cloud destination. Do not include reusable skill examples with
client-specific IDs, names, URLs, or paths.

When both an audit/cleanup plan and a change log are requested, produce separate
deliverables by default because they belong to different lifecycle moments:

- an audit/cleanup plan workbook or report after the audit, for decisions and
  proof;
- a standalone change log workbook or CSV only after cleanup execution or
  generated cleanup artifact creation.

Only combine them when the user explicitly requests one file. If combined, the
change-log tab must still follow `change-log-template.md` exactly and the
workbook must open on the decision layer, not on proof or raw-change tabs.
If no cleanup was executed, do not call the artifact a real change log. Use
`planned change preview` or `simulated post-cleanup change log`, depending on
the user's request.

## Required Closing Question

End audit and cleanup-plan results with a concrete next execution decision, for
example:

```text
Recommended next step: approve the cleanup route. I can either create a new GTM
workspace and apply the approved operations directly, or prepare an importable
JSON if you prefer manual import. A real change log will be produced after
cleanup execution.
```

Offer a planned change preview before execution only when it helps approval.
Do not ask to create a real change log until cleanup was executed or a generated
cleanup artifact was produced.
