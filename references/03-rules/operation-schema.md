# Operation Schema And Scenario Intelligence

Use this reference to turn audit findings into route-aware cleanup operations.

## Cleanup Aggressiveness

Audit depth and mutation aggressiveness are separate decisions.

| Level | Use when | Allowed changes | Requires explicit approval |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Conservative | User asks for minimal risk, production is fragile, evidence is thin. | Clear broken references, no-trigger tags, obvious payload mistakes, documentation of risks. | Deletes, broad renames, consolidation, consent behavior changes. |
| Standard | Default execution level after a complete audit. | In-place fixes, safe naming, obvious unused candidates after dependency sweep, single-member trigger-group flattening, low-risk duplicate cleanup. | Consent model changes, vendor payload redesign, major gateway refactor. |
| Deep | User approves full cleanup and evidence is strong. | Cross-layer consolidation, helper variables, reusable triggers, broad naming, obsolete-object deletion after QA, custom-code hardening. | Transformational architecture changes or business-semantic changes. |
| Transformational | Container needs redesign, migration, or server-side/gateway architecture change. | New gateway pattern, ecommerce data contract redesign, server-side migration, market architecture changes. | Always requires a signed-off plan and staged execution. |

Default to a complete deep audit. Default cleanup plans and direct execution to
`Standard` as the recommended level unless the user approves `Deep` or
`Transformational`. Never reduce audit coverage just because a specific change
is blocked.

## Aggressiveness Choice Contract

Cleanup plans must make the aggressiveness choice visible to the user. For every
operation where more than one level could reasonably apply, include:

- the recommended aggressiveness;
- the available alternative levels;
- what each alternative includes or excludes;
- the risk and QA impact of each alternative;
- any level that is blocked, unsafe, or not applicable, with the reason.

Do not force the user to infer that `Standard` was chosen. If the recommended
level is obvious, still show why lower or higher levels were not selected when
the operation is material, consent-sensitive, destructive, or cross-layer. If a
step has only one safe level, state that and explain the blocker for the other
levels.

## Audit-To-Plan Completeness Gate

A cleanup plan must be compiled from a complete semantic audit, not from an
inventory subset. Before producing the final operation set, reconcile each
material object family against the audit ledger:

- Measurement diagnosis;
- Tags;
- Triggers;
- Variables;
- Custom HTML tags;
- Custom JavaScript variables;
- Custom templates;
- Consent settings and routing;
- Ecommerce/dataLayer contracts;
- Official documentation contracts;
- Naming/folders;
- Unused and consolidation-obsolete objects.

For each family, record one of these outcomes: operation(s) proposed, no change
needed after semantic validation, deferred with blocker, not applicable, or
user-excluded. Do not omit a family because no obvious mutation was found. Do
not allow an inventory-only or dependency-only family to disappear from the
cleanup plan; either finish semantic validation or mark the family deferred.
Do not allow a family with missing measurement diagnosis to become
cleanup-ready; keep it unresolved or deferred with the exact owner, runtime,
server, or dataLayer blocker.

For families with no mutation, record a report-only `Document exception`,
`Keep`, or proof/reconciliation row so coverage is auditable. Surface it in the
visible cleanup plan only when the no-change decision is material to approval,
debugging, QA, owner follow-up, or risk acceptance. For unresolved families,
include the failed phase, affected objects, blocker, required next evidence,
risk, and recommended next action. A cleanup plan with unresolved families may
still be useful, but it must be labeled `Incomplete / blocked` and must not
claim full cleanup readiness.

Do not convert missing audit work into a cleanup operation. Actions such as
`review custom code`, `perform line-level review`, `check variable config`, or
`validate trigger logic` are not cleanup operations when they are needed to
decide correctness. Complete that analysis during audit, or mark semantic
validation `Deferred`/`Incomplete / blocked` with the affected objects and
required evidence. Runtime QA, owner validation, safe rewrite after QA,
template migration after QA, or no-change documentation are valid operations.

Use `Deferred` for D4/runtime, owner, legal, server, or mutation blockers after
D1-D3 have been completed from available evidence. If D1-D3 are not completed,
the operation set is not cleanup-ready; mark the affected workstream
`Incomplete / blocked` and keep unresolved counts nonzero.

## Route Decision Matrix

| User need | Preferred route | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Modify existing objects in place | Direct GTM/MCP/API | Preserves IDs and workspace history. |
| Broad naming standardization | Direct GTM/MCP/API | GTM JSON merge is name-conflict based and can show add/delete churn. |
| Delete obsolete objects | Direct GTM/MCP/API or overwrite/new-container JSON | Same-container merge JSON cannot reliably delete omitted existing objects. |
| Human-readable GTM View Changes | Direct GTM/MCP/API, or name-preserving same-container JSON | Rename-heavy JSON is not readable. |
| Portable manual artifact | Importable JSON | Useful when no live access exists. |
| New-container migration | Full importable JSON | Existing-object conflict behavior is not a constraint. |
| Rollback / backup | Export JSON | Do not treat backup as a cleanup artifact. |

If the route is direct GTM/MCP/API, create a new workspace first. If workspace
creation is blocked by a limit, stop and alert the user before writing.

If the route is JSON for same-container View Changes, preserve existing names
and explain that naming standardization is deferred to direct cleanup or a
separate final-state artifact.

## Operation Object Schema

Represent every proposed or executed cleanup as a structured operation:

| Field | Required meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `change_id` | Stable unique ID, such as `GTM-OP-001`. |
| `recommended_aggressiveness` | Conservative, Standard, Deep, or Transformational. |
| `aggressiveness_options` | User-selectable levels for this operation, with include/exclude scope, risk, QA impact, and blockers. |
| `route` | Direct GTM/MCP/API, Same-container JSON, Overwrite JSON, New-container JSON, Report-only. |
| `layer` | Workspace, Tag, Trigger, Variable, Built-in variable, Folder, Template, Server-side object, Website/dataLayer. |
| `action` | Add, Update, Rename, Delete, Replace, Flatten, Consolidate, Defer, Document exception. |
| `object_id` | GTM ID/path when available. |
| `before_name` | Required for existing objects. |
| `after_name` | Required for rename, replace, or new object. |
| `semantic_role` | Vendor/event/business purpose. |
| `semantic_status` | Keep, Fix, Consolidate, Delete candidate, More info needed, or Not applicable. Required for cleanup-relevant objects. |
| `coverage_phase_status` | Inventory, dependency map, measurement diagnosis, semantic validation, cleanup decision, and report reconciliation status for the affected family. |
| `reconciliation_status` | Complete, incomplete, blocked, or not applicable. Required for report-only/deferred rows. |
| `reason` | Finding, official-doc contract, dependency issue, or user decision. |
| `official_doc_basis` | Source title/URL or `Not applicable`. |
| `dependencies` | Consumers, trigger groups, setup/teardown, variables, folders, templates, custom-code refs. |
| `risk` | Data, consent, privacy, performance, release, rollback, or owner risk. |
| `qa_method` | Preview/debug, Tag Assistant, network, vendor helper, export diff, API readback, owner validation. |
| `rollback` | Exact rollback object/export/version or direct reversal. |
| `status` | Proposed, Approved, Applied, Verified, Deferred, Rejected. |
| `blocker` | Required when deferred or rejected. |

Do not execute an operation table that lacks dependencies, QA method, rollback,
or route for any mutation.

The operation table is the source of truth for cleanup decisions. A change log
must mirror applied/generated operations by `change_id`; it must not introduce
new analysis, different impact wording, or different object status that was not
present in the approved/generated operation.

Semantic logic checks should normally be folded into existing `reason`,
`blocker`, `risk`, and `qa_method` fields. Add a separate traceability field only
when the user requests a deeper technical workbook.

## Operation Packet Fields

For cleanup plans, compile operations from reconciled operation packets. The
packet is the bridge between raw scan artifacts and the plain-language visible
plan. It must be present even when the workbook hides it.

Required packet fields:

| Field | Required meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `operation_id` | Stable ID used by visible plan, proof tabs, execution tracker, and change log. |
| `affected_objects` | Names and IDs of every object changed, deleted, kept as exception, or blocked. |
| `object_identity` | `layer + object_id + object_name + object_type + code/config hash` when available. |
| `source_lenses` | Which independent lenses contributed: deterministic, semantic, technical. |
| `current_behavior` | What the source export/API/code shows now, in plain language. |
| `problem` | The specific defect, risk, duplicate, obsolete object, or blocker. |
| `why_it_matters` | Business, data-quality, privacy, performance, maintenance, or release impact. |
| `expected_clean_state` | What should be true after cleanup or after the documented exception. |
| `exact_proposed_action` | Delete, keep/document, update, rename, consolidate, harden, rebuild, defer, or QA, with the concrete object state. |
| `preconditions` | Owner, legal, runtime, server, dataLayer, route, or workspace requirements before mutation. |
| `qa_steps` | Preview, Tag Assistant, network, vendor, API/readback, owner, or dataLayer checks. |
| `rollback` | Exact reversal, rollback export/version, or restore route. |
| `technical_handoff_packet` | Required when `source_lenses` includes technical; carries object ID/name, identity/hash, referenced variables, external scripts, and side effects for the next analyst or agent. |
| `confidence` | High, Medium, or Low. |
| `blocker` | Required when the packet is not cleanup-ready. |
| `priority` | Relative order based on risk, value, and dependencies. |
| `resolution_status` | `cleanup_operation`, `documented_exception`, `runtime_blocker`, `owner_decision_needed`, or `not_applicable`. |
| `source_finding_ids` | Deterministic, semantic, and technical finding IDs or row IDs that justify the packet. |

The visible cleanup plan should be a translation of these packets, not a new
analysis layer. If an operation packet cannot say the exact proposed action,
expected clean state, QA, and rollback, the visible row must be a blocker or
owner decision rather than a cleanup action.

Shared action vocabulary:

- `delete_candidate`: object appears removable after dependency and owner QA;
- `fix_required`: existing object behavior is incorrect or unsafe;
- `consolidate_candidate`: two or more objects can likely become one clearer
  implementation;
- `harden_required`: code/security behavior should be made safer;
- `rebuild_candidate`: existing implementation is too fragile to patch safely;
- `rename_candidate`: behavior is coherent but name/scope is misleading;
- `document_exception`: keep unusual setup with a reason and QA evidence;
- `runtime_blocked`: D1-D3 is done, but live/server/platform evidence is
  needed before mutation;
- `owner_decision_needed`: business/legal/platform intent is needed;
- `keep`: no cleanup action after validation.

## Operation Compiler

Compile audit findings into operations in this order:

1. Normalize inventory and dependency facts.
2. Load independent deterministic, semantic, and technical finding artifacts
   from raw source evidence. Do not let the compiler recreate one lens from
   another lens' summaries.
3. Match scan rows by object identity: layer, ID, name, type, and code/config
   hash where available.
4. Diagnose business model, decision outcome, conversion hierarchy,
   vendor/platform role, and expected data contract for affected meaningful
   families.
5. Attach official documentation contracts to GA4 and vendor-event findings.
6. Reconcile material object families against the audit ledger and identify any
   family that is still inventory-only or dependency-only.
7. Populate the semantic object matrix for every tag, trigger, variable, custom
   template, and referenced configuration branch in a full audit. Finish
   recursive D3 semantic validation, or mark unresolved rows incomplete/blocked
   with evidence.
8. Build the semantic model for meaningful object families and link every
   finding or operation back to object-level matrix rows or documented
   exceptions.
9. Run semantic logic checks for value, quantity, item, lead, media, shared
   variable, and custom-code logic.
10. Select applicable optimization patterns without flattening business meaning.
11. Classify findings by business impact and risk.
12. Apply conflict rules when lenses disagree; prefer blockers or documented
   exceptions over guessed cleanup.
13. Create operation packets with current behavior, problem, expected clean
   state, exact proposed action, preconditions, QA, rollback, confidence, and
   source finding IDs.
14. Choose recommended cleanup aggressiveness.
15. Add selectable aggressiveness options and tradeoffs for each material
   operation.
16. Choose execution route.
17. Generate operations with route-specific mutation style.
18. Validate dependencies and blockers.
19. Batch operations for execution.
20. Run post-batch readback and update statuses.

For direct GTM/MCP/API, prefer `Update` or `Rename` on existing IDs. Use
`Replace` only when a new reusable concept is needed or the API/tool behavior
makes in-place mutation unsafe.

For same-container JSON, use `Update` only when GTM can match the existing name.
Use `Replace` with old-to-new mapping when conflict behavior makes in-place
import unreliable.

## Scenario Playbooks

### Ecommerce Accuracy

Use when GA4, Ads, Meta, affiliate, or remarketing tags depend on product/order
data.

- Map current website/dataLayer payload for each ecommerce event.
- Verify official GA4 and vendor event contracts.
- Validate core ecommerce variables before tag fields.
- Fix dataLayer-readiness issues before inventing GTM-side helpers.
- Test empty, one-item, multi-item, missing currency, missing quantity, and
  missing product ID cases.

### Consent And CMP

Use when Didomi, OneTrust, Cookiebot, Axeptio, Consent Mode, or regional rules
affect firing.

- Identify default state, update state, CMP-ready events, and region logic.
- Separate legal/business decisions from technical implementation.
- Align pageview/base tags for the same vendor unless a documented reason
  exists.
- Never collapse consent triggers if timing changes are not proven safe.

### SPA Or PWA

Use when the website changes route without full page reload.

- Identify history-change, route, virtual pageview, and dataLayer events.
- Check duplicate pageviews and stale ecommerce data after navigation.
- Require runtime browser evidence; JSON alone cannot prove route behavior.

### Multi-Market Or Multi-Language

Use when names, hostnames, paths, currencies, or variables contain market codes.

- Verify that market names are enforced by trigger/filter/dataLayer logic.
- Ask about unclear product or campaign tokens before consolidating.
- Prefer lookup/regex tables only when ownership and QA remain clear.

### One-Tag Gateway

Use when many tags differ only by vendor ID, event name, market, or payload
mapping.

- Identify dispatcher, loader, lookup-table, server endpoint, or custom HTML
  gateway candidates.
- Prefer gateway consolidation only when it improves maintainability without
  hiding consent, ownership, or vendor-specific payload rules.
- Treat gateway failure blast radius as a risk.

### Advanced Consolidation

Use when repeated objects may be combined through lookup tables, regex tables,
helper variables, payload mappers, or gateway routing.

- Load `optimization-patterns.md`.
- Consolidate only after semantic model checks prove shared business meaning or
  a safe dynamic scope field.
- Prefer dynamic conditions over hardcoded duplication when they remain readable
  and QA-able.
- Do not combine objects that differ by business objective, consent category,
  product/market ownership, platform optimization use, or payload shape.

### Server-Side GTM

Use when server container evidence exists or migration is requested.

- Inventory clients, tags, transformations, consent forwarding, endpoint domain,
  and monitoring.
- Validate browser-to-server and server-to-vendor payload contracts separately.
- Check event deduplication IDs for browser/server dual tracking.
- For web-container Google tags or Google event tags that appear to route into a
  server container, use a validation operation before any mutation. A
  placeholder-looking measurement ID, media-oriented Google event name, or
  missing browser-side blocking trigger is not enough evidence to edit, pause,
  or delete the tag when destination routing or consent enforcement may be
  handled server-side.
- Record the required proof: server container export/API readback, network
  payload, consent parameters forwarded to the server, server transformations,
  and final server-to-vendor destination mapping.

### Emergency Fix

Use when the user asks for a fast production repair.

- Limit the operation table to the critical issue.
- Document skipped cleanup scope explicitly.
- Preserve a rollback export and recommend a full audit afterward.

## Cleanup Intelligence Rules

- A currently unused object is not automatically safe to delete; consolidation
  design can change deletion candidates.
- A similar object is not automatically a duplicate; market, consent, product,
  or ownership scope can justify separation.
- A scalar product ID is suspect when a vendor expects an array or object.
- A helper that reads old dataLayer history is suspect when the event context
  requires the current ecommerce action.
- A formula that resolves is not automatically meaningful; totals, quantities,
  lead values, item arrays, content IDs, and media payload fields must make
  logical sense against source event, output type, and consumers.
- Missing business logic can be a finding even when all current GTM objects are
  technically valid; record website/dataLayer/server blockers instead of
  inventing GTM-side guesses.
- Missing measurement diagnosis blocks cleanup for meaningful affected objects.
  Do not rename, delete, consolidate, rewrite, or patch them until their
  business/platform role is known or explicitly deferred.
- A name that says a country, product, consent vendor, or event must be enforced
  by configuration or renamed/deferred.
- A custom HTML tag that only defines a function is a probable no-op unless
  runtime evidence proves an external caller.
- Custom HTML and Custom JavaScript triage is not enough for planning. Every
  cleanup-relevant custom-code object needs export-level code/config inspection
  and semantic status, or the plan must be labeled incomplete for that object.
  Runtime proof may be deferred before mutation; code inspection may not.
- A D3-required object is not semantically validated unless source/code logic,
  inferred output or side effect, consumer expectation, and correctness decision
  have been recorded.
- Operation rows and cleanup plans must be user-facing decision/action records.
  Include what is wrong or changing, affected objects, impact, recommended
  action, QA/debug method, owner/blocker, status, and next action. Keep raw D3
  proof, code/config dumps, hash signatures, dependency graphs, and validator
  details in backing evidence tabs. Use `summary-quality.md` for wording.
- A Google tag or Google event tag with server endpoint, S2S naming, routing
  parameters, or consent-forwarding parameters is a client-to-server candidate;
  classify uncertain destination IDs or missing browser-side blocking triggers
  as server-side validation blockers, not automatic cleanup actions.
- A JSON artifact is not complete until it is self-audited as a fresh export.

## Batch And QA Gates

Use small batches for direct cleanup:

1. Workspace and rollback snapshot.
2. Helper variables and lookup/regex tables.
3. Consent and scoping triggers.
4. Vendor/event-family tag updates.
5. Trigger-group flattening and consumer remapping.
6. Obsolete-object deletion after verification.
7. Final naming and folder placement.
8. Fresh export/readback and report update.

Do not mix consent-routing changes, payload changes, and broad naming in one
batch unless the container is tiny and the user approves the combined risk.

## Regression Checks

Before delivering any generated artifact or executed cleanup summary, check:

- No missing trigger, variable, folder, setup-tag, teardown-tag, or custom
  template references.
- Built-in variables are preserved when import JSON is used.
- Custom template layers are complete when `cvt_...` types are present.
- Same-container View Changes JSON has no broad rename churn.
- Direct cleanup operations target the approved workspace only.
- Single-member trigger groups are flattened or route-limited with deletion
  instructions.
- Change log columns match the required template.
- Residual blockers are explicit and owner-actionable.
