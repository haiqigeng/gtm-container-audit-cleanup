# Cleanup Operation Schema

Compile operations only from three validated reviews. Audit findings describe a
problem; operations describe an exact proposed mutation.

The packet carries the source, context, and shared-fact hashes. It also carries
a decision ledger covering every source obligation, execution phases,
projected object counts by layer, and a target-state preservation entry for
every source-confirmed measurement family.

Compilation is fail-closed on source identity. The source must be a complete
ContainerVersion shape with modeled entity layers, valid object records, and
unique IDs. Missing or duplicate IDs, malformed entity lists, or an unmodeled
top-level list block operations instead of being silently ignored.

## Contents

- Dispositions and human fields
- Source identity, layer coverage, and behavior-impact alignment
- Structured creations, additions, field changes, remaps, deletions, and renames
- Consolidation and challenge review
- Merge/conflict rules and action completeness

## Dispositions

Use one:

- `cleanup_operation`
- `keep`
- `documented_exception`
- `owner_decision_needed`
- `container_evidence_limit`
- `not_applicable`

Operational findings use `documented_exception` rather than `keep` so every
mechanical anomaly remains visible. For a deterministic operational defect,
only `cleanup_operation` or a source-locked `documented_exception` is valid in
the final plan. A locked `review_candidate` may also use `keep` or a precise
`owner_decision_needed`; a locked true business choice may use the owner
decision. Configuration and architecture
may use `container_evidence_limit` or `not_applicable` only where their own
validators and evidence boundary allow it.

An unresolved owner or evidence-limit decision is not an empty fallback. It
contains one precise question and one concrete recommended action. A final plan
cannot leave a deterministic operational defect or source-proven configuration
Issue in `owner_decision_needed`.

## Required Human Fields

Each operation contains:

- unique `operation_key` and generated `operation_id`;
- title, area, and supported problem type;
- concrete problem and why it matters;
- expected clean state;
- exact proposed action;
- preconditions, QA steps, and rollback;
- priority, confidence, and execution readiness;
- source run(s), source review IDs, and evidence object keys;
- affected mutation objects;
- affected measurement-family IDs and the business behavior retained through
  the target state.

Use the shared taxonomy in `scripts/gtm_taxonomy.py`. Do not combine unrelated
issues under `Generic hygiene batch` merely to reduce rows.

## Structured Mutations

### Field Change

```json
{
  "object_key": "tag:123",
  "json_path": "$.containerVersion.tag[4].parameter[2].value",
  "before": "{{Old Variable}}",
  "after": "{{Canonical Variable}}"
}
```

### Object Creation

```json
{
  "layer": "variable",
  "object": {
    "variableId": "99",
    "name": "Constant - Currency",
    "type": "c",
    "parameter": [{"type": "TEMPLATE", "key": "value", "value": "EUR"}]
  },
  "reason": "Create the missing source required by the approved target state."
}
```

The object must be complete and use an identity that does not already exist.

### Missing Field Or List Addition

```json
{
  "object_key": "tag:123",
  "json_path": "$.containerVersion.tag[4].parameter",
  "mode": "append",
  "value": {"type": "TEMPLATE", "key": "currency", "value": "{{Currency}}"},
  "reason": "Add the approved currency parameter to the existing event tag."
}
```

Use `set` for one missing object field, `append` for a list tail, and `insert`
with an exact index for a list position. Do not represent a missing field as a
change with a fabricated `before` value.

### Consumer Remap

```json
{
  "from_object_key": "trigger:10",
  "to_object_key": "trigger:20",
  "consumer_object_keys": ["tag:5", "tag:8"]
}
```

List the exact complete source-graph consumer set. A partial consumer move is a
field change, not a source-object remap. Variable remaps update `{{Name}}`; trigger
remaps update firing/blocking/group IDs; tag remaps update setup/teardown names;
folder remaps update parent IDs.

Zone boundary remaps update boundary trigger IDs. Name-based references in tags,
variables, Google tag configurations, templates, clients, transformations, and
Zones must resolve to exactly one source object; an ambiguous name is not a
valid remap target.

### Deletion

```json
{
  "object_key": "variable:21",
  "reason": "Duplicates variable 20 after all consumers are remapped."
}
```

### Rename

```json
{
  "object_key": "variable:20",
  "before": "Items",
  "after": "DLV - ecommerce.items"
}
```

Renames must remain unique within the GTM layer and update name-based references.
Field changes and renames must have different before/after values. A no-op is
not an operation and cannot satisfy an architecture cleanup obligation. Every
field addition/change path must sit under the source object named by its
`object_key`; pairing a valid key with another object's path is invalid.

## Decision Ledger And Execution Order

The decision ledger contains one row for every operational finding,
configuration object, architecture family, and relationship comparison. Each
row states its originating review ID, disposition, and linked operation ID when
cleanup is selected. No source obligation may disappear during reconciliation.

Human presentation may batch homogeneous duplicate, unused, naming, folder, or
generic hygiene operations. The JSON operations remain atomic, and every
operation ID, structured mutation, affected object, approval choice, and QA
must remain recoverable exactly once from the visible plan.

Apply approved operations in dependency-safe phases: create objects; add missing
fields/list members; apply logic correction; remap consumers; flatten trigger
groups and sequencing; rename; delete; then readback validation. The simulated
packet records before/after/delta counts for tags, triggers, variables,
templates, folders, clients, transformations, Zones, Google tag configurations,
and built-ins where applicable.

## Consolidation

Every consolidation identifies:

- `canonical_object_key`;
- why variants are equivalent at configuration and architecture level;
- every consumer remap;
- every non-canonical deletion;
- expected post-remap unused objects;
- QA and rollback.

An unused duplicate may require no remap, but still requires canonical selection
and deletion. Sanitation consolidation must align with an architecture operation.

## Challenge Review

High/Critical operations require source recheck, active/paused and scope check,
plausible alternative explanation, and confirmed/downgraded/rejected/blocked
verdict. This protects consent, revenue, paid-media, server-routing, and
multi-market changes from over-inference.

## Merge And Conflict Rules

- Reconcile operations when their complete structured mutations are identical,
  even if independent lenses use different wording or operation keys.
- Preserve every lens rationale and source reference in the reconciled packet.
- Reject one operation key reused for different structured mutations.
- Reject different targets for one field, rename, or remap source.
- Reject deleting an object that is changed elsewhere.
- Reject remapping to an object selected for deletion.
- Reject cross-layer or unsupported-layer remaps and any remap that creates a
  dependency cycle through its consumer.
- Reject newly duplicated final names after applying the complete accepted
  creation, rename, and deletion set.
- Reject mutation of an unresolved or intentional-variant architecture comparison.
- Reconcile every behavior-impacting change with architecture, even when it is
  not a consolidation. Logic, destination, trigger, routing, consent, schedule,
  sequencing, and deletion changes must be supported by architecture or blocked
  when architecture keeps the behavior or remains unresolved.
- Require architecture support for creations that introduce a new behavioral
  object or route. Export-only metadata, notes, folders, and reference-safe
  naming changes do not become behavior changes merely because their JSON differs.

## Action Completeness And Approval

Compile every justified operation into one proposed action set. Action
completeness passes only when:

- each cleanup disposition links to a compiled operation;
- each deterministic operational defect is an operation or intake-locked
  documented exception, while each retained review candidate includes
  source-specific proof of its intentional distinction;
- each source-proven configuration Issue is an operation;
- each genuine owner or evidence-limit decision includes the analyst's concrete
  recommended action.

Do not classify operations into cleanup levels or defer them through an
aggressiveness setting. Before mutation, the analyst approves all operations or
an explicit list of operation IDs. Any changed selection requires a regenerated
future-state simulation before execution.
