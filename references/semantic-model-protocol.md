# Semantic Model Protocol

Use this reference after inventory and dependency mapping. It defines the
internal model an agent should build before judging cleanup, consolidation, or
business-logic correctness. The model is a reasoning tool, not a required
stakeholder-facing report section.

## Purpose

Model the container as a measurement system:

```text
business objective -> user action -> event/context -> GTM objects
                   -> data source/formula -> destination payload
                   -> platform use -> QA evidence/blocker
```

This prevents superficial cleanup from hiding business defects. A duplicate tag
can be harmless, while a technically valid conversion tag can train bidding on
the wrong action or send a nonsensical value.

## Model Layers

Build these layers for meaningful object families:

| Layer | Questions |
| --- | --- |
| Business objective | What business outcome does this object appear to support: sale, lead, appointment, brochure, content engagement, ad revenue, retention, audience, attribution, or utility? |
| User action | What user behavior or backend outcome should trigger the signal? |
| Event/context | Which page, event, form, product, market, language, consent state, or server route is required? |
| GTM implementation | Which tags, triggers, variables, templates, custom code, folders, setup/teardown, and built-ins implement it? |
| Data source | Is the source current dataLayer, previous dataLayer history, DOM, URL, cookie, constant, lookup/regex table, server container, or platform-side mapping? |
| Payload contract | What event name, value, currency, item/object shape, ID, lead type, consent, and dedup fields should be sent? |
| Platform use | Is the signal for bidding, reporting, audience, exclusion, attribution, enhanced matching, consent modeling, or server forwarding? |
| Evidence | Is correctness proven by export, official docs, runtime QA, vendor platform, owner decision, or still blocked? |

## Inference Rules

Infer intent from names, folders, tag types, vendor fields, triggers, variables,
official documentation, website context, and repeated patterns. Then verify the
configuration enforces the inferred intent.

Do not silently assume:

- a tag named `Lead` is a qualified lead;
- a thank-you page belongs to one form type;
- a country/product/campaign token is enforced by a trigger;
- a shared variable has the same meaning for all vendors;
- a static value is acceptable for every conversion;
- a server-side route preserves the same consent and payload semantics.

If intent is plausible but unproven, create a blocker or owner question only
when it affects a cleanup decision, mutation safety, QA, or measurement quality.

## Missing Logic Detection

After mapping the implemented objects, infer likely missing pieces from the
container's own design:

- A lead-generation site has form-submit tags but no lead type, form name,
  program, campus, or value differentiation.
- Ecommerce conversion tags exist but no reliable item array, transaction ID,
  currency, discount, tax, shipping, or quantity source exists.
- Media conversion tags exist but no event ID or deduplication key exists where
  browser/server duplicates are plausible.
- A product/category naming pattern exists but triggers or variables do not
  enforce the product/category scope.
- A server-side endpoint exists but the web container does not forward the
  fields needed for server transformations, consent enforcement, or vendor
  routing.
- Several vendors track the same apparent business event but receive different
  trigger timing, IDs, values, currency, or item payloads without rationale.

Treat inferred missing logic as `More info needed` or a website/dataLayer/server
blocker unless the export/runtime evidence proves the defect.

## Semantic Model Checks

Before producing cleanup operations, verify:

- every high-risk tag has one inferred business objective or a documented
  ambiguous objective;
- every conversion/media/ecommerce tag has a source-of-truth path for the values
  it sends or a blocker;
- every reusable trigger/variable keeps compatible semantics across consumers;
- every proposed consolidation preserves scope, ownership, consent, and vendor
  payload shape;
- every proposed deletion has been re-evaluated after consolidation design;
- missing pieces of an inferred business flow are recorded as blockers or
  optional future work, not as fake GTM-side fixes.

## Reporting Discipline

Do not add a large semantic-model dump to normal cleanup plans or change logs.
Use the model to improve:

- finding evidence;
- operation reason and blocker;
- QA method;
- owner questions;
- deferred website/dataLayer/server work;
- confidence level.

Create a dedicated semantic traceability tab only when the user asks for deep
review evidence or when a high-risk decision would otherwise be opaque.
